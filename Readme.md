This is a example mod for how to port a weapon from the clump dump (https://github.com/pistakilla/T6-Mod-Tool-Batches/raw/main/weapon_clump_dump.zip)

I have left an example build bat that you would use with Open Asset Tool to build this mod

All mods for plutonium T6 must be created with OAT, see below link for further information on how to build a mod.

If you need any help porting weapons from clump dump or SP/ZM to MP feel free to DM @gunjibra on twitter.
